Forge port for [Food Effect Tooltips](https://github.com/DaFuqs/FoodEffectTooltips).

Adds Tooltips to food that gives Status Effects when eaten

Quite a few food items grant the player bonuses in the form of status effects. These effects, however, are never listed ingame. Which is a nuisance, especially in modded scenarios, where the player is not acquainted with all food options and their effects.

With Food Effect Tooltips all effects are shown in the items tooltip!
- includes effects that only get applied with a % chance
- shows stat changes for effects
- works fully client side
- compatible with other mods that display food information, like AppleSkin
